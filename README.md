# Compass

Compass is a voice-first movie and series discovery experience designed for the
living-room TV. Instead of opening a catalogue and scrolling indefinitely, the
viewer describes the mood, occasion and constraints out loud. Compass holds a
short conversation and will progressively turn that context into a small,
understandable set of recommendations.

This repository contains the TV frontend, the independently deployable voice
agent, and a FastAPI backend prototype. The backend already serves a unified
content catalogue (movies, TV schedule and live football), activity logs and
ML-based recommendations. The frontend and voice tools use its existing endpoints.

```

The browser never receives provider secrets. It starts a voice session against
the local agent and exchanges microphone and speaker tracks over WebRTC. The
agent owns provider credentials and is the only layer that calls SLNG and
Nebius.

## Technologies and responsibilities

| Technology | Where | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React + TypeScript + Vite | `frontend/` | TV interface and application flow |
| Zustand | `frontend/src/store/` | Profile, voice and recommendation state |
| Motion for React | Frontend | Shared-layout and staggered recommendation animations |
| Pipecat client + SmallWebRTC | Frontend | Real-time microphone, remote audio and agent events |
| Unmute | `voice-agent/` | Declarative agent definition and Pipecat compilation |
| Pipecat | Generated runtime | Real-time voice pipeline and WebRTC server |
| SLNG | Voice runtime | Speech-to-text and text-to-speech execution |
| Nebius Token Factory | Voice runtime | Conversational reasoning model |
| Silero | Voice runtime | Local voice activity and turn detection |

## Hackathon challenge strategy

### Titan OS: TV-first experience

Compass is designed as a ten-foot interface rather than a desktop application:

- every important action is reachable with directional focus and OK/Back;
- focus states are high-contrast and use the Compass cyan brand colour;
- the primary Home action is voice, reducing remote-control typing;
- the conversation has explicit listening, thinking, speaking, paused and
  recommendation states;
- recommendations arrive progressively and can be frozen for calm exploration;
- Titan-specific APIs will remain behind `frontend/src/platform/` so browser
  simulation and device runtime can share the product code.

The current limitation is explicit: it has not yet been validated on a Titan OS
television. The browser build simulates screen proportions, remote navigation
and interaction flow until device access is available.

### Best use of the SLNG platform

SLNG is in the critical audio path, not an optional add-on:

```text
viewer speech
  → SLNG deepgram/nova:3 speech-to-text
  → Nebius conversational reasoning
  → SLNG deepgram/aura:2 text-to-speech
  → TV speakers
```

The agent uses the EU-West SLNG route. A small repository-owned adapter batches
adjacent twenty-millisecond WebRTC frames, reducing approximately three thousand
WebSocket audio messages per minute to approximately fifteen hundred. This stays
below the observed two-thousand-message-per-minute bridge limit while adding at
most one input-frame interval of buffering.

### Unmute bonus

`voice-agent/agent.yaml` and `voice-agent/instructions.md` are the source of
truth. Unmute validates this portable definition and compiles it into a Pipecat
runtime that the team owns and can run locally. Provider and model choices stay
declarative instead of being embedded throughout application code.

### Build, adapt and ship with Nebius Token Factory

Nebius Token Factory provides the LLM for every conversational turn. The current
model is `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507`, accessed through Nebius' OpenAI-
compatible endpoint. It interprets viewing intent, decides which clarification
is valuable and produces concise spoken responses. The same model invokes
recommendation and cached-detail tools using the active
`profileId`.

This is a meaningful dependency: replacing or removing Nebius removes the
reasoning layer of the live agent rather than a peripheral feature.

## Run locally

### 1. Start the backend

Install the dependencies and train the models as described in [BACKEND.md](./BACKEND.md), then:

```sh
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Configure the voice agent

Copy the example and add local credentials. Never commit or expose these values
through a Vite variable.

```powershell
Copy-Item voice-agent\.env.example voice-agent\.env
```

Required variables:

- `SLNG_API_KEY`
- `NEBIUS_API_KEY`
- `NEBIUS_BASE_URL`

### 3. Start the voice runtime

```powershell
.\voice-agent\scripts\dev.ps1
```

On Linux/macOS, with Unmute 0.4.2 and uv on PATH:

```sh
python voice-agent/run.py
```

The agent listens on `http://localhost:7860`. Leave it running while using the
Compass frontend. An idle server does not hold an active conversation; disconnect
voice sessions after testing to conserve SLNG credit.

### 4. Start the frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. Allow microphone access when prompted.

### TV controls

- Arrow keys: move focus.
- `Enter`: select.
- `Escape` or browser Back: return.
- `V`: activate the current voice control.

## Recommendation flow

`Profile.id` is the backend username. HTTP requests send `X-Profile-Id`, and
the WebRTC start body carries `{ sessionId, profileId, mode }`.

| Frontend mode | Backend endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `discover` | `POST /api/content/preference` |
| `consensus` | `POST /api/content/room` |
| `decide` | `POST /api/content/decide` |

Voice tools merge structured preferences and emit `recommendations.updated`.
The frontend adapts the event's catalogue items into the same session cache used
by the board and detail page. Pause mutes microphone and remote audio; navigating
to details and back keeps the connection, candidates and selection. Resume uses
that connection. Leaving the session for Home or profiles clears its context.

The backend has no content-by-ID route: details are available only for items
cached during this session. Refreshing the browser loses that cache.
Playback and provider deep links remain future work.
